Description
-------------------
This is a repo for odoo 10 installer.

(+) Internet connection (strong).
(+) debian distro ubuntu and the others.


Usage
--------------------
/home/user/Desktop$ chmod +x odoo-10-installer.sh.
/home/user/Desktop$ ./odoo-10-installer.sh.

Issues
--------------------
(+) wkhtmltopdf needs to be installed separately if it refuses.
(+) issues with sys links maybe, worked for me, but make sure paths are as they are.
    If you get "File already exists", don't worry its cool!, just move on to next step.
(+) For thoses with pip became any pip3 edit and add "pip2" where "pip",
    odoo 10 uses python 2 so pip2.
